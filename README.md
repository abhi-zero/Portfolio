# Abhinandan Bhatti ‚Äì Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio! This site showcases my journey as a developer, my learning projects, and my approach to building, breaking, and refining code. It features modern UI/UX, advanced GSAP animations, custom canvas effects, and a fully responsive design.

- **GSAP Animations**: Smooth, interactive animations for engaging user experience.
- **Custom Canvas Effects**: Dynamic fractal/canvas backgrounds and interactive controls.
- **Dynamic Project List**: Projects are loaded and rendered dynamically from JavaScript.
- **Accessible & Semantic**: Uses semantic variables for color, accessible markup, and keyboard navigation.
